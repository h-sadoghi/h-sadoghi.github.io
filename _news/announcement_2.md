Your homework and mini-project should meet the following criteria:

1. **Research-Based Preparation**: Gather information from a variety of sources and references, merging theoretical understanding with practical programming to experiment with the concepts learned.
2. **Submission Format**: Submit your work as a Jupyter Notebook in `.ipynb` format. The notebook should include well-structured explanations in markdown and relevant Python code. (Markdown syntax guide: [https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/typography.html](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/typography.html))
3. **Deadline and Penalty**: The work must be submitted within 15 days. After the deadline, it will **be invalid**, and failure to meet the deadline will result in a reduction of your eligibility for future assignments.
4. **Author Details**: After the title, use a level 1 heading (`#`) to include the following details: your full name, affiliation, contact details (email and/or phone), website (if any), and a profile picture of the author.
