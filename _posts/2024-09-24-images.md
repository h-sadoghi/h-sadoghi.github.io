## Part of Abstract

Predicting stock price breakouts or reversals at critical chart levels—known as Change of Character (CHoCH)—is a complex challenge due to the intricate interplay between market data, global news, social media, and economic indicators. This paper introduces a novel methodology that leverages a vast network of interconnected information sources, advanced data analysis techniques, and sentiment analysis to forecast these pivotal market movements with unprecedented accuracy.
