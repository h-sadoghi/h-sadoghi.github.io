## Introduction
### Applications of Indoor Positioning

Today, most outdoor positioning systems rely on satellites and are based on the **Global Positioning System (GPS)**. These systems are highly accurate for outdoor navigation but struggle with precise indoor positioning due to **weakened satellite signals inside buildings**. To address this issue, new technologies known as *indoor positioning systems* (IPS) have been developed. IPS is widely used in places like schools, offices, supermarkets, hospitals, and universities. For example, in supermarkets, shoppers can use a shopping cart with a digital guide screen and RFID tags to locate products. In museums, visitors can use Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices to find information about exhibits. IPS can also assist students in finding specific shelves in a library and is used in targeted marketing, where advertisements are tailored to individuals' preferences and locations within a building, such as sending clothing ads to those frequently visiting clothing stores.
