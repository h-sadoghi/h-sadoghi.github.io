Real Time emotion detection system include following parts:

**Camera**:
   - **Function**: The camera captures video frames or images of subjects (e.g., users or participants) in real-time.
   - **Importance**: It serves as the primary input device, enabling the system to acquire visual data necessary for emotion recognition through facial expressions, body language, and other visual cues.

**Real-time Recognizer**:
   - **Function**: This module processes the incoming images and applies algorithms (such as machine learning or deep learning) to analyze facial expressions, gestures, and other features that indicate emotional states.
   - **Importance**: It is the core of the system, providing the ability to classify emotions (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger) instantly, which is crucial for applications requiring immediate feedback.

**Monitoring**:
   - **Function**: The system continuously observes and analyzes the emotional state of the subject over time, allowing for a dynamic assessment of emotional changes.
   - **Importance**: This component is vital for applications such as mental health monitoring and interactive systems, where understanding the emotional context is essential for appropriate responses or interventions.

**Data Storage**:
   - **Function**: The system stores collected data, including captured images, recognized emotions, and timestamps, for future analysis and reporting.
   - **Importance**: Storing data allows for longitudinal studies, trend analysis, and the potential to improve the accuracy of emotion recognition algorithms through machine learning by using historical data for training and validation.
